                        building, which is the best embodiment of Muslim civilization in south Asia and its lush <br>
                        green lawns attract visitors from all over the country and abroad. It is not only the <br>
                        culminating point of the Aligarh Movement, it is in fact the beautiful combination of Aligarh<br>
                         and Deoband Schools of Thought. Being the breeding ground of the Pashtun <br>
                         intelligentsia, this great seat of learning is the place, where diamonds are skimmed since 1913.<br>
                          Moreover, Islamia College Peshawar was destined to become mother institution of the<br>
                           three universities and several colleges on its campus. The credit of this goes to Sir <br>
                           Sahibzada Abdul Qayyum, who is commonly called The Sir Sayyed of the Frontier and his <br>
                           sincere colleagues, who founded Islamia College Peshawar in 1913.</p>

             <p>Islamia College Peshawar is the best example of endowments. According to the Board of Trustees, the College,<br>
                 which is spread over 300 acres of land, has 1089 Jaribs cultivable land in Harichand, Rai Killi and<br>
                  Tarnab, (District Charsadda). In addition to this there are 395 shops <br>
                  and flats in the Khyber Bazaar Peshawar and main bazaar Charsadda. 

                Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah visited this College in 1936, 1945 and 1948. Quaid-e-Azam who<br>
                 became lifelong honorary member of the Khyber Union ICP in 1936 made the College one of the heirs of his <br>
                 property in 1939. The Quaid Trust later on paid an amount of Rs.1, 08, 11, 600 /- in different installments<br>
                  to the College.</p>
